## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 & CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Fixating on achieving pixel-perfect resemblance to the original design is pointless, as different methods can result in different outcomes.
- Getting to use flexbox and grid is always nice - had to look up that the last element in a flex group has to be aligned with margin: auto.

### Continued development

I may use CSS variables for more complex projects in the future, but they didn't seem necessary here, where most colors are used only once or twice.
